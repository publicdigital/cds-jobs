review: "We love Who Gives a Crap! They sell sustainable toilet rolls and other paper goods made from recycled bamboo-based paper, without the plastic wrappings. Getting a delivery optionally on subscription also makes it really convenient, so you never get caught without. The paper wrappers mean they'll also be the cutest toilet roll you've ever displayed in your bathroom."
