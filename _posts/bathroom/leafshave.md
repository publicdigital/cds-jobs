review: "Leaf makes two models of all-metal razor that take 1, 2 or 3 blades, so you can replace your plastic disposable or plastic-cartridge-refillable razors with something that works in the same way. The replaceable blades are recyclable metal that you can simply mail back to the company. The initial buy is a little spendy, but it should work out cheaper in the long run if you're buying disposables already."
