review: "It's rare to see a lipstick that's completely waste free, but Axiology's Balmies are plastic-free paper-wrapped sticks of lip, cheek or eye colour. They're in a nice range of colours and are sold in little handmade card boxes for protection. Axiology also sell a more traditional lipstick in an aluminium tube worth a look, but steer clear of the Crayons and hand products that contain non-recyclables and plastic."
