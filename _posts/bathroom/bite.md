<h2>Why Less Mess recommends</h2>
<p>Bite's toothpaste and mouthwash really work, with a good forumla including NHAP, and the tabs are given to you in refillable glass jars. We also like their focus on constantly improving their products, recently upgrading their nylon non-compostable toothbrush bristles to fully-compostable castor-bean-based bristles. They offer everything on subscription or one-time only purchase.</p>
