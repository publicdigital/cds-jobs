review: "Instead of buying full new bottles of cleaning products, Blue Land offers tablet packets that are mixed with water to make up your own bottles of cleaners and handwashes. They'll encourage you to buy their own bottles, but Less Mess recommends you just pickup the refill tablets and reuse bottles you already have on hand (like your last empty plastic bottles!). They also sell a range of laundry and dishwasher tablets and a dish-washing powder. Subscription option available."
