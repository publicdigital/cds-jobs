review: "Zero Grocery delivery grocery is new and currently only available in California's Bay Area, but we hope to see them expand. They do a full-range of pantry goods, dairy, meat, bakery, fruit and vegetables and sell a lot of it at bulk-buy prices in returnable glass jars. They also have a selection of home goods."
