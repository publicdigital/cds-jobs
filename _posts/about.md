title: About Less Mess
---
## {{ title }}
<p>It's easy to say "just use less" or "go green", but the truth is that we're all busy people who don't have the time to research and compare each individual item we need to purchase. At Less Mess, we're making it a little bit easier for you to make zero waste choices by researching and gathering up companies offering zero waste by default and leave the consumer with no plastic.</p>

### Plastic is a problem
<p>Even though plastic recycling is more accessible than ever before, just 8.4% of plastics overall<sup><a href="#ref1">[1]</a></sup> in the US actually successfully recycled. Due to the high volume of plastics that simply can't be recycled, and those that can be but aren't good enough quality<sup><a href="#ref2">[2]</a></sup>, most of the plastic that gets put into the recycling system still ends up in landfill.</p>

### Putting pressure on governments and corportations
<p>You may think that it's not your fault there's so much plastic - governments allow corporations to use as much trash and plastic as they like with little to no consequences - and you'd be absolutely right!</p>
<p>As an end consumer, you don't have much control over what's allowed to be used and produced, except that you do have <strong>purchasing power</strong>. By choosing where to spend your money on products you want or need to buy anyway, you can put pressure on companies to make changes to more eco-friendly options. Additionally, by showing your desire to be more green, you're telling the people, and governments, around you that you want better and you'll be showing that in the way you vote and make decisions in other parts of your life.</p>

### Are you being paid to list these products?
<p>No.</p>
<p>This site doesn't take any fees or payment for recommendations, it's simply a list of products and services we know work well for normal people who just want to make less mess in the world.</p>
<p>We don't make any money from the listings and we won't take payment in exchange for a listing.</p>
